# MercuryMedialWalkInClinic


Mercury Medical Walk-In Clinic System is a web application created using JSP, Java Servlets and JSTL. It can be used by both patients and practitioners but will focus mainly on the patient. All information is stored to and retrieved from the local Mercury database (mySQL). The mercury database is a local database that contains 7 tables: users, practitioners, patients, appointments, addresses, provinces, and menuFunctions. All functions in the side menu are derived from the menuFuctions table. All functions are controlled by servlets, which redirect requests to the respective JSP.
